Information System Design Sessional Project


## Uniforum

### What is UniForum ? 
UniForum is an all-in-one platform for University specific discussion, announcement, Q &A. There is a lack of online platform for students in a university to discuss
problems or share resources. Additionally, their questions are too course
specific to be asked on sites like Stack Exchange . So they are forced to use
unsuitable social media apps like Facebook, which is distracting. UniForum
aims to solve this problem.
